# Wine-Quality-Analysis
This Repo analysed based on some general chemical properties in winemaking, the effect of this properties on the quality of the wine
Wine tasting is said to be an art. For centuries many people have been practicing this profession, where guided by the smell, color and taste of the wine they give them a rank.There are 13 variables and 6497 observations in the dataset, these are:- 1522 red wines and 4898 white wines. 11 input variables which are the chemical properties of the wine. 1 output variable is the score given by at least 3 wine experts rated the quality of each wine, providing a rating between 0 (very bad) and 10 (very excellent). The objective of the analysis part is to see the effect of each chemical propertuy on the quality of the wine.
Data variables and definition

Atributes Information:
* Fixed Acidity (tartaric acid - g / dm^3)
* Volatile acidity (acetic acid - g / dm^3)
Citric acid (g / dm^3)
Residual sugar (g / dm^3)
Chlorides (sodium chloride - g / dm^3
Free sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
Total sulfur dioxide (mg / dm^3)
Density (g / cm^3)
PH
Sulphates (potassium sulphate - g / dm3)
Alcohol (% by volume)
Quality (score between 0 and 10)

Description of Atributes: 
Fixed acidity: Most acids involved with wine or fixed or nonvolatile (do not evaporate readily)
Volatile acidity: The amount of acetic acid in wine
Citric acid: Found in small quantities, citric acid can add ‘freshness’ and flavor to wines
Residual sugar: The amount of sugar remaining after fermentation stops
Chlorides: the amount of salt in the wine
Free sulfur dioxide: The free form of SO2 exists in equilibrium between molecular SO2 (as a dissolved gas) and bisulfite ion; it prevents microbial growth and the oxidation of wine
Total sulfur dioxide: Amount of free and bound forms of S02; in low concentrations, SO2 is mostly undetectable in wine, but at free SO2 concentrations over 50 ppm, SO2 becomes evident in the nose and taste of wine
Density: The density of a substance is its mass per unite volume
PH: Describes how acidic or basic a substance is on a scale from 0 (very acidic) to 14 (very basic)
Sulphates: a wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (S02) levels, wich acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant
Alcohol: The percent alcohol content of the wine
Quality: Score between 0 and 10
